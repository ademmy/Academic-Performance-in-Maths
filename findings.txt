The text editor registered all the features as objects
I'll do analysis of the categorical features first and then see what pops up
Categorical Features

so the data set came with all features categorised as objects and so i had to convert most to integer values so we could see correlation.
The total number of numric values we have in the dataset is set at 19.
So next i'll group the categorical and the numerical features into sepreate dataframes and perform analysis on both sides
Now that that's done, the next thing is to explore both parites and see what they have in them

NUMERICAL FEATURES
The scores in the first and second term have the best correlation with the final score in the last term

Features with correlation are:
1. G3: G1, G2, Medu
2. G2: G1, G3, Medu Fedu
3. G1: G2, G3, Medu, Fedu
4. absecnces: age, Walc, Dalc
5. Walc: Dalc, freetime, goout, failures, absences, age, traveltime
6. Dalc: Walc, freetime, goout, failures, absences, age, traveltime
7. goout : Walc, freetime, Dalc, age, failures, 
8. famrel: freetime
9. failures: age, Walc, Dalc
10. Fedu: Medu, G1, G2, G3
11. Medu: Fedu, G1, G2, G3.
12. age: failures, absences, Dalc, goout, Walc

So next i binned the G3 scores and I found the relationship between the score distribution in relation to other features.

It should also be noted that most of the students in this distribution has scores higher than the set average with a percentage of 58.54%
The percentage of students with scores lower than the set average is set at 25.77% and the percentage of students with average scores
is set at 15.68%

so I discretized the scores and converted them to categorical features. [below average, average, above average]

I did all the necessary encoding and all.
First Used Logistic regression and i got
